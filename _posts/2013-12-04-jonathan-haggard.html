  <p class="tn">Chengdu, hometown of the giant panda，has embraced pandas with extensive concern and effective protection from the government and the community alike.</p>

  <p class="tn">Unfortunately, some other rare species, such as black snub-nosed monkey in Kunming, rhinoceros in Sumatra and red wolves in America, though endangered as pandas, are living in extremely challenging conditions without being protected properly and cared about as they deserve to be. This is partly due to their unattractive appearance and poor fame.</p>

  <p>In order to protect more animal species under the successful mechanism of panda conservation and meanwhile arouse the public concern over those animal species living in threat, I and my two other frineds, Andy Zhu and Tianxing Lan launched "Panda 1+1"</p>

  <p class="tn sep">The significance of the panda as a flagship species is beyond doubt, but how to make the best of its role has become my primary concern after participating in Panda conservation activities. </p>

  <p>"Panda 1+1" offers a solution. For one part, in this world of consumerism we inevitably dwell in, even environmental propagandas need some stunts, and Panda 1+1 will attract expansive concern under the fame and popularity of panda; when people get involved, they will realize more animal species need to be protected. </p>

  <p>For another part, by learning from the successful mechanism of panda conservation, more animal preservation program will be promoted.</p>

  <p class="pull-quote">This may not change the world, but the world will not be possibly changed if we remain sitting</p>


  <p>We developed the official website for "Panda 1+1" to update the latest activities.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/3.jpg" style="height:640px"></p>

  <p>I, together with many volunteers and animal lovers, organized several activities, such as a knowledge forum, an engaging “zookeeper experience,” and the collection of donations in Kunming's local zoo. We also promoted the activities in the newspaper to call upon the public to participate in the protection of the Black snub-nosed monkeys. </p>
